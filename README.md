# Pokémon Auto Chess Companion - PACC
PACC was made to add a couple of QOL updates to Pokémon Auto Chess

## Features

- When receiving new Pokémon Avatars via Boosters, the newly collected ones will now be visible in the Collection tab
- Right clicking a Pokémon or viewing a Pokémon's details in the Team Builder tab will show the Meta Items for the Pokémon based on the selected Elo in the settings
- Pokémons in the shop and in the propositions list (unique and legendary selection) will now highlight synergies that you already have. E.g. 3 Normal type synergy -> Munchlax will have its Normal type synergy highlighted
- Incase a player's avatar is missing (no image found) the image will be replaced with the Pokémon's default avatar
